## First and Second Project
Utilization of a graphics engine in WebGL and improvement of WebGL utilization techniques [WebCGF](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ruirodrig/pub/sw/webcgf/docs/). This scene was inspired in Minecraft, even though it has some obvious outcasts, since we needed to implement nurbs.

## Third Project
LYNGK visual interface developed in WebGL to represent the game states of a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) board game, Lyngk, and make use of a game [interface](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui). See more about this game [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217083/lyngk).
